# Langchain-google-palm-fine-tuning-database-Q-A
In this repository I have fine tunned the langchain lllm Google PALM to answer question to database with out giving a query.

I used fewshot learning technique to minimize the error and add more dictionaries to fewshot.py file to your use-case for negligible error rate.

main.py == streamlit app

fewshot.py == list of dictionaries for fewshot learning

cloths.py == python file for streamlit file

cloths.ipynb == jupyter notebook for source code

cloths_db.text == text file for creating database..
